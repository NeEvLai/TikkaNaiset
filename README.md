# Welcome to Tikka Naiset Stats website

This site's purpose is to gather game statistics during on on-going season, as well as to refresh the author's web development coding skills. The original code was written as a school assignment for the Web visualization course for JAMK University of applied sciences. The site was build using the Bulma CSS library. The original site contained the main site (home page) and three sub pages, but for this site I decided to drop the other pages, and leave only the stats page.

## About the author / Disclaimer

I'm still learning my ropes in web development, so this site might be rough around the edges. Any improvements, hints, tips and friendly advice are welcomed. I have a few courses worth of experience in HTML and CSS, some experience in C# (not used here though), I use basic SQL in my work as a Service Delivery Specialist, I've taken one course on Full Stack development that introduced me to JavaScript and little experience with Python, Jupyter Notebook, shell scripting and PowerShell scripting. The scripting was fun and I had also one course about ML programming with python. I don't think that I'm made for programming but I'm interested in website development and CSS. It's fun to see what one line of code can do to the entire wesite!

This piece of work is written by me entirely.

## Team Introduction

Tikkakosken Tikka Naiset plays ringette in a regional hobby league. The players' age varies from 16 to 36 years, and players' careers from a few years to few decades. The team practises twice a weeks and there is an average of 12 games per season, depending on how many teams have enrolled to the league each season. 

## Future Plans for the site

My plan is to maybe create a stats website that could also show some history data from past seasons. To achive this my plan is to create a database, maybe with NoSQL (MongoDB), or some other DB service (That's free), where I could add the team for each season, and the site would then fetch the necessary information from the database as the season is selected. This would require some database planning and designing. Some new dropdowns or radio buttons, plus JavaScript needs to written to get the data, so a little full stack development needed there as well.
